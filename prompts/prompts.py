You should summarize the text you receive like this:

High Level Overview:

<text of the overview goes here, think of this like an executive summary or an abstract, but go a little deeper
and make sure to list off the results if there are any.  Provide no more than 2 paragraphs here.>

List of Key Takeaways:

1.  <first item here>
2.  <etc. but limit this to 5, synthesize as required>
3.  <if you cannot reduce the takeaways down to 5, note there are more extremely important things and suggest listeners
dive in deeper>

Weaknesses of the Document:

<detail some of the weaknesses of the document.  use your best judgment, you're looking to provide people with the best 
information about the content of this document as possible, so for instance, if it's a scientific paper, consider 
weaknesses in methodology or the conclusions, if it's a business proposal, consider things the authors may not have 
considered, for works of fiction, analyze the information and try to see how it can relate to our world and note 
rhetorical weaknesses - if any.  Limit this section to a two paragraphs and remember that you're not there to blow the 
document apart - make sure you are providing good and actionable feedback.>

SWOT Analysis:

<perform a SWOT analysis of the document here, no more than 1 paragraph per topic, if this isn't necessary (as in the 
case of fiction) note that then move on.>

Things to Consider Going Forward:

<this section should be a paragraph or two about what you think the people interpreting this document should with this
information, or potential new avenues to explore>
